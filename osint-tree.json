This way, attack/input vectors that would otherwise be undetectable by non-humans can be handled seamlessly.\n\nMoreover, due to its integrated browser environment, it can also audit and inspect client-side code, as well as support highly complicated web applications which make heavy use of technologies such as JavaScript, HTML5, DOM manipulation and AJAX.\n\nFinally, it is versatile enough to cover a great deal of use cases, ranging from a simple command line scanner utility, to a global high performance grid of scanners, to a Ruby library allowing for scripted audits, to a multi-user multi-scan web collaboration platform."

The top window always shows a list of the currently active processes, including the names of their owning accounts, whereas the information displayed in the bottom window depends on the mode that Process Explorer is in: if it is in handle mode you'll see the handles that the process selected in the top window has opened; if Process Explorer is in DLL mode you'll see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded. Process Explorer also has a powerful search capability that will quickly show you which processes have particular handles opened or DLLs loaded.\nThe unique capabilities of Process Explorer make it useful for tracking down DLL-version problems or handle leaks, and provide insight into the way Windows and applications work."

You can choose how many subnets you need and adjust certain ranges to have more or fewer IP addresses. Whether you’re expanding your network or starting from scratch, properly subnetting your network ensures that you won’t need to scramble to get new IP addresses in the future. Creating subnets within your network can help with everything from organizing your network by department, location, or device type and keeping spare IP addresses available, to segregating your network and limiting communication between groups which can help contain virus outbreaks. For more information, see Why subnet your network? The benefits of subnetting."
