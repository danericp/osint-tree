Get more information on KAPE, access training materials or book a live session with a Kroll expert here.\nWith KAPE, you can find and prioritize the most critical systems to your case and collect key artifacts before imaging.\nPurpose–Built to Expedite and Optimize Forensic Investigations; Predefined, Continually Updated Targets and Modules, Actionable Intelligence in Minutes, Standardize Forensic Processes\nKAPE has two primary phases – target collection and module execution: Targets are essentially collections of file and directory specifications. Modules are used to run programs, which can target anything, including files collected via targets as well as any other kinds of programs you may want to run on a system from a live response perspective.\nKAPE gives you access to targets and modules for the most common operations required in forensic exams, helping investigators gather a wider range of artifacts in a fraction of the time, enriching evidentiary libraries."
